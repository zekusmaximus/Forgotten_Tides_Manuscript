Gorgi stared at the little floater as it propelled itself toward the crumb he'd set on the edge of the table. He put his hand up to block its view of the morsel. Suddenly it stopped, did a quick mid-air spiral and wandered toward the ceiling. Gorgi chuckled to himself, reaching up to redirect the floater toward its meal.

He felt his weight on the chair as he shifted, remembering playing floaters with his brothers as a child. They'd run around with their arms out, pretending to float into the sky, bumping into each other, saying "who are you?" and "where am I?".

They were fond memories, and Gorgi wondered why he hadn't recalled them before now, given the floater infestation had begun the moment the ship had slipped into the corridor to Heavonly. That was days ago. He tried to bring up other memories of his childhood, searching his mind for those softer places in simpler times.

"Please don't tell me you're feeding those things!" Gorgi turned to see his pod captain, Fuin, coming into the kitchen. "You do realize it's our job to clear them from the ship after we drop out of the corridor, right?"

He did realize that. What he hadn't realized was what a big job it was going to be. This was Gorgi's first time on a ship with a memory drive. He was a general ship tech on a planet where most of the population would never leave the system, never mind cruise corridors to opposing spiral arms. There was a lot he hadn't been taught.

"I didn't purposely drop a crumb to feed a floater boss, if that's what you're implying." That's exactly what Fuin had been implying, and exactly what Gorgi had indeed done.

"So you're messy, that's worse."

Gorgi sighed and wiped the table with his sleeve, brushing a few other crumbs into his palm. He looked apologetically at Fuin, dropping the collected morsels into the foil meal container and folding it back up for recycling.

Fuin set his own container onto the table and took the seat next to him, brushing away another floater as it meandered around the room. "You got floaters planetside?"

"Yeah," Gorgi replied, trying to remember what he'd been thinking about before Fuin had come in.

"Unusual for a mid planet." It was. Gorgi had never considered it. Floaters were basically weightless, they had no memory at all. They were much more common on light planets, but Gorgi wasn't sure how uncommon they were on others.

"Beyond my pay grade boss." Gorgi admitted, unable to come up with anything to further the conversation. He wasn't sure he'd known the captain either hadn't been down planet, or if he had he may not have had reason to leave the elevator platform.

"Well, luckily clearing them off is squarely within your pay grade." Fuin laughed as he continued to eat his meal.

Gorgi got up and slid his container into the recycling slot. His break was quickly coming to an end so he shuffled off to the main bay to join the rest of his work pod. Today they were certifying landcraft for shipment to the front part of the ship.

It wasn't glamorous, but he had to admit his tech job on in-system freighters wasn't exactly the height of prestige either. He'd taken the job that was available, and he'd do it with a smile. It was after all what got him onto the Raoniar, a half passenger, half cargo ship fitted with a memory drive and bound for the other side of the galaxy.

The opportunities to get something in his specialty would be far greater on Heavonly. Not only was it ten times as populated and a political hub, it was the jumping off point for three other galaxies! His next job could even be on one of the big corridor cruisers, ships built to handle long hauls between galaxies.

He had to cut his reverie short as he walked into the cavernous hold, where what seemed like endless landcraft awaited inspection. These were the big ones, reinforced for heavy planets. To Gorgi it just meant longer checklists. Grabbing a screenpad he entered his credentials and pulled up the list of unchecked units.

Walking over to the first he took stock of the machine. A sleek black metal frame sat far above the ground on thick omnidirectional treads. Unlike the crawlers on his planet there was no discernible front or back, left or right side. Payload chambers were on all four sides, each with a passage to the center control chamber.

Opening the closest, Gorgi crouched through and into the cabin. He found the main diagnostic panel and pressed his screenpad against it, bringing up a simple interface. He frowned when he saw three red flashing indicators, all in difficult to reach areas on the underside of the landcraft.

Punching in a test run on the artificial intelligence and software package he backed out of the cabin. It could run itself while he checked out these errors underneath. Sitting in the sterile air while they ran was boring and uncomfortable anyway.

He nearly hit his head jumping when someone right behind him yelled out, "Gorgi!"
