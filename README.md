# Forgotten Tides — Manuscript Repository

This repository contains the working manuscript for my novel **_Forgotten Tides_**, drafted and revised entirely in public.

The project is a work of science fiction exploring memory, gravity, and a sprawling new universe. All prose is authored by me and maintained here as a living draft.

## Why this repository is public

This repository is public for transparency and authorship provenance.

Drafting, revision, and structural changes are committed incrementally, with cryptographic signing and encrypted commit history where appropriate. The intent is to maintain a verifiable, human-authored record of the novel’s development from first draft onward.

## Structure

The manuscript is organized hierarchically:

- Acts → Chapters → Scenes  
- Each scene exists as its own Markdown file  
- YAML frontmatter is used for metadata only (not counted as prose)

Supporting scripts are included to generate accurate word counts and maintain internal consistency.

## Status

This is an active draft. Content, structure, and metadata are subject to change until publication.

Please note: this repository is not intended as a collaborative or feedback forum, and issues/pull requests are disabled by design.
